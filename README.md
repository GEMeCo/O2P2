About
-----
O2P2 is an object oriented framework for the Positional Finite Element Method applied to Thermomechanical Problems. It was developed for non-linear coupled thermo-mechanical analyzes (:construction: We'll get there, eventually :construction:).

Citation
--------
  Whether it was used in whole or parts, citation is a must! Our software is under development, and a proper presentation paper is underway.

  Our software is in Zenodo - thus, we got a DOI: [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7102199](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7102199)
  
  Nevertheless, if you may, please cite the one following papers (as they were used for initial validations):

Building and Running
--------------------
1. Clone the source code
`git clone https://github.com/GEMeCo/O2P2.git`

2. Install development dependencies and resources. Just check above.

3. We provided the .vsxproj file. Some configuration may be needed. Good luck :innocent:.

4. Run the executable file and input the project file. Check the documentation to create the project file.

Documentation
-------------
Software documentation is made directly from annotated sources by doxygen. Use doxywizard to create the documentation.
